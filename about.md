Hey! I'm Josh. A second-year Combined Business and Computer Science Major at the 
University of British Columbia, currently enrolled in the [BUCS programme](https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/program-requirements/combined-major-in%C2%A0business-and-computer-science).

This summer I joined the Commerce Undergraduate Society (CUS) at UBC as an [IT Associate](http://it.cus.ca/). My role 
currently involves handling IT ticket support requests and creating back-end development projects

Coding is something that I've really started to enjoy and pursue this past year after taking a few computer science related
courses. I enjoy hackathons and hope to attend more throughout the year to develop my skills and figure out which areas of 
computer science that I want to dive into. I've developed a recent interest in Data Science and have started looking into projects through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

In my spare time I sketch landscapes, take photos, and listen to music. Hoping to write in my blog more and feature some of my more creative projects!
