Hey! I'm Josh. A second-year Combined Business and Computer Science Major at the
University of British Columbia, currently enrolled in the [BUCS programme](https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/program-requirements/combined-major-in%C2%A0business-and-computer-science).

This summer I joined the Commerce Undergraduate Society (CUS) at UBC as an [IT Associate](http://it.cus.ca/). My role
currently involves handling IT ticket support requests and creating back-end development projects
to increase the efficiency and accessibility of varying features for users within the CUS.

I'm currently working on developing my two most recent [hackathon](https://joshflchan.github.io/bizhacks-visualeyes/)
[projects](https://joshflchan.github.io/nwhacks-ichooseyou/) with my teammates at a steady pace during the academic term. Within
the past few weeks, I will have attended 3 consecutive hackathons -- And hoping to attend many more!

#### Currently looking for Summer 2019 student intern positions || Winter 2019 Co-op positions

Coding is something that I've really started to enjoy and pursue this past year after taking a few computer science related courses. I enjoy hackathons and hope to attend more throughout the year to develop my skills and figure out which areas of
computer science that I want to dive into. I've developed a recent interest in Data Science and have started looking into projects through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

In my spare time I sketch landscapes, play Tetris, and listen to music. Hoping to write in my blog more and feature some of my more creative projects!
