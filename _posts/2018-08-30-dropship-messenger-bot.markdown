[Doggo Sploot](https://www.instagram.com/doggo.sploot/) is a dropshipping store that I started with a friend as a side business to earn some extra money while in school. Currently market on instagram, but plan on creating a stronger presence on facebook as well. 

A messenger bot was created to promote products and automate business process of answering basic customer inquiries about the store. Created with Python, Flask framework, and ngrok. 

Project is currently on hold. Waiting for App Permissions approval from Facebook to be published on Messenger Platform. Currently unable to deploy and test code :disappointed:.
