[Doggo Sploot](https://www.instagram.com/doggo.sploot/) is a dropshipping store that I started with a friend as side business to earn some extra money while in school. Market mainly on instagram, but plan on creating strong presence on facebook as well. A messenger bot was created to promote produces and automate business process of answering basic customer inquiries about the store. Created with Python, Flask framework, and ngrok. 

Project is currently on hold. Waiting for App Permissions approval from Facebook to be published on Messenger Platform. Currently unable to test code :disappointed:.
