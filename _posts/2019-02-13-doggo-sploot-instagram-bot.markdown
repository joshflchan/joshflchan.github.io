#### Project Idea
The motivation behind this project is to streamline the marketing aspect of personal dropshipping business.

**Problem**: Instagram API does not allow access to posting functionality, inhibiting ability to use services that
will auto-post

**Solution**: Plan on setting up a server and using Selenium to auto-post through Instagram's web interface. Will also
create web scraper to take top posts from r/doggos subreddit and credit respective users.

#### Additional thoughts
- May have difficulty posting slideshow images on Instagram's web interface (1 for meme and 1 for advertisement).
- Is it possible to store web-scraped images somewhere, perhaps personal VPS?

*Update (02/14/4:16PM): My friend Ian found a private API with Nodejs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/instagram-private-api?fbclid=IwAR2NgCNnxgFHMWotBrPIi9PuAx_dwUHHM5bHXnZM70bgsL6AMojIsAIdwFs   
I can't believe I overlooked private APIs :sweat_smile:*

**New Solution**: Same idea but with private API, hopefully will no longer require Selenium.
